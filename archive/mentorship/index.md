[**Women in Econ/Policy**](https://www.womenineconpolicy.com/) (a registered non-profit) is an India-based organisation working to correct the persistent gender gap in economics and policy.

We are a community of 2000+ women in the early or mid stages of their careers. Membership is restricted to individuals who identify as women, and is — and will always remain — free.

We send members a fortnightly newsletter curating job opportunities, scholarships, and fellowships. Members stay connected through a WhatsApp community, as well as city- and career track-level chapters. We are also currently working with eight colleges across India to provide resources and mentorship opportunities at scale.

**To become a member,** please fill out the Google Form on our [website](https://www.womenineconpolicy.com/). You will be added to the mailing list and receive the WhatsApp group link within 15 days.
