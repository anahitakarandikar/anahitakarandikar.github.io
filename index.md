Hello! I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the Vancouver School of Economics (University of British Columbia).  My research fields are behavioural development economics and political economy, with a focus on gender and caste.  I am a Director at [Women in Econ/Policy](https://www.womenineconpolicy.com/), an India-based non-profit working to reduce the gender gap in economics and public policy.

I received an MA in economics from Ashoka University and a BA in economics from Fergusson College, Pune.  I was a research associate at the [Behavioral Development Lab](https://behavioraldevlab.org/) at J-PAL South Asia, where I worked on projects related to mental health.
