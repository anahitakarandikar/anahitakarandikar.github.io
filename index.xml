We are a community of 2000+ women in the early or mid stages of their careers. Membership is restricted to individuals who identify as women, and is — and will always remain — free.
We send members a fortnightly newsletter curating job opportunities, scholarships, and fellowships. Members stay connected through a WhatsApp community, as well as city- and career track-level chapters.</description></item></channel></rss>
